      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Frog Runner Deluxe is a gravity-based 2D platformer developed over approximately seven months. The project focuses on physics-driven movement, environmental interaction, combat mechanics, and enemy behavior within a structured level layout.

      <h2>Project Goals</h2>
      <p>
        The primary goal of this project was to design a cohesive platformer system that integrates movement physics, collision handling, camera control, and multiple combat mechanics while maintaining consistent player control and responsiveness.

      <h2>Engineering Challenges</h2>
      <p>
        One major challenge was maintaining stable collision behavior across static platforms, moving platforms, destructible objects, and collisions between objects with differentt velocities. This required separating collision resolution logic from movement updates to avoid clipping and inconsistent player positioning.
