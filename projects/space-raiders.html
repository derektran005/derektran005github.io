      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Space Raiders is a top-down 2D roguelike shooter emphasizing inertia-based movement, modular weapon systems, and state-driven enemy behavior in an infinite, mapless environment.

      <h2>Project Goals</h2>
      <p>
        The goal of this project was to explore non-traditional movement and combat mechanics by simulating space-like inertia, weapon recoil, and system-driven player decision-making.
      </p>

      <h2>Engineering Challenges</h2>
      <p>
        Balancing inertia-based movement with player control required careful tuning of acceleration, rotational velocity, damping, and weapon recoil to avoid disorientation while preserving the intended “slippery” feel.
      </p>
      <p>
        Designing enemy behavior that reacts to the player’s aim during reload states required decoupling movement logic from attack logic and introducing predictive avoidance behavior.

            <li>
              Ranged enemies with finite-state machines:
              <li>Attack state</li>
                <p>Pursues player and fires ranged projectiles when in range</p>
              <li>Reload state</li>
                <p>Evasive behavior, avoiding player's aim</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

    <p>
    This project reflects a long-term iterative development process, where new mechanics were layered onto existing systems while preserving stability and player control.
